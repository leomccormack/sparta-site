These plug-ins employ parametric processing and are signal-dependent. They aim to go beyond conventional linear Ambisonics algorithms, used by the baseline SPARTA plug-ins, by extracting meaningful parameters over time and subsequently employing them to map the input to the output in a more informed manner.

Currently, the plug-ins support sampling rates of 44.1 or 48kHz. All spherical harmonic-related plug-ins conform to the Ambisonic Channel Number (ACN) ordering convention and offer support for both orthonormalised (N3D) and semi-normalised (SN3D) normalisation schemes; note that the AmbiX format uses ACN/SN3D.</description></item><item><title>COMPASS suite</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/docs/plugins/compass-suite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/docs/plugins/compass-suite/</guid><description>Plug-in descriptions COMPASS VSTs is a collection of flexible VST audio plug-ins for spatial audio production, manipulation, and reproduction, developed by Dr. Archontis Politis, Leo McCormack and Dr. Sakari Tervo in the Acoustics Lab at Aalto University.
COMPASS is a framework for parametric spatial audio processing of sound scenes captured in the Ambisonics format. Parametric methods, such as Directional Audio Coding (DirAC) or HARPEX have gained notoriety recently for being able to achieve sharpness or envelopment beyond first or lower-order traditional Ambisonics playback, using the same lower-order Ambisonics signals.</description></item></channel></rss>
