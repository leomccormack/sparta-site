A website for the spatial audio VST plug-ins installer, which includes the SPARTA suite, COMPASS suite, HO-DirAC suite, CroPaC-Binaural decoder, and the HO-SIRR application.

## Deployment

A github action is automatically run every time a commit is pushed to the master branch, which builds and deploys the website.

The website is hosted here: [https://leomccormack.github.io/sparta-site/](https://leomccormack.github.io/sparta-site/)

## Contributing

We are by no means exports in website design, so if you happen to be wesite, Hugo or Doks guru and spot anything that can be improved, then please feel free to do so and submit a pull request : )
